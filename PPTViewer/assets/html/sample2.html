<HTML>
<HEAD>
Nothing between the head tags is seen by people except the title 
(if you look at the top left of your screen on your browsers titlebar you should see the title of this page 'html tutorial and examples, learn html')
there are lots of other things that we can put in the head section, like meta tags and javascripts but the only thing that goes in the head section of the page that need concern us now is the title
<TITLE> my first web page </TITLE>
</HEAD> 

<BODY> 
All the information that you want people to see goes between the body tags
</BODY>
</HTML>

formating the page

there are lots of html tags available for formatting a webpage
If we add the <CENTER> tag immediatly after the <BODY> tag then everything in the document will be centered, but remember to close the </CENTER> tag immediatly before the closing </BODY> tag

lets add a few line breaks too with the <BR> tag
Â°note the <BR> tag does not have a closing tag

<BODY>
<CENTER>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
This is my very first webpage, aint i clever?
</CENTER>
</BODY>
